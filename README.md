# TRON Bike Game Remake in C++ openFrameworks

## Required openFrameworks Add-ons
The only required add-on is ofxLight2D which can be found [here](https://github.com/bakercp/ofxLight2D).

## Build Instructions
1. You must have openFrameworks downloaded on your computer. You can download it from [here](https://openframeworks.cc/download/).
2. Navigate to the ~/apps/myApps folder within the openFrameworks package.
3. Clone the Tron game inside the folder.
4. Then use the Project Generator provided with the openFrameworks package to generate a project. Make sure to add the 
ofxLight2D addon by using the drop-down menu in the Project Generator GUI.
5. If you are on a Mac, the project generator will be provide you with an Xcode project that you can simply open and build. If you are
on a Windows computer, the project generator will provide you with Visual Studio project files that you can use to open and build
the Tron game. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdH5DAYYU0w) helps show the project generator process if you are 
still unsure how to build the project.
