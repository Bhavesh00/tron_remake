# Image & Sound Credits
## Image
1. The image I used for the bike was taken from the top-down tron bike image located in this [article](https://www.asphaltandrubber.com/news/tron-lightcycle-design-daniel-simon/). I then edited the images so that there would be colors for the bike.
2. The image I used for the Tron logo on the menu screen came from [here](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tron-logo.svg).

## Sound
1. The background music that I used for this game was Daft Punk-Derezzed, and came from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4eccPBFEjE).
2. The explosion sound I used for the game was called "Metal Explosion / Car explosion sound effect" and came from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uldk2U0dwDM).
